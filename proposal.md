## Description
A 2d game where you're tasked to make a pancake, you're given a list of ingredients and if you overdo it, you fail.

## Features
- Click mouse button/allow something to be clicked
	- I will look up tutorials to help figure out how the code works.
- Change photo
	- I will look back on our old codes and search for tutorials as well.
- Have exit button 
	- I will look at how to code in a button to exit the program.

## Challenges
- I need to figure out how to make a mouse click do something.
- I need to make sure photo will change when I click a certain area.
- I need to have a exit button so the user isn't forever playing.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- The ideal outcome is a working game with a list of ingredients, all the ingredients working correctly and a final success/fail screen.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- I will have some ingredients and a success/fail screen.
